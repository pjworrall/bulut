# MusicNotes ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

MusicNotes is a tool for making notes against a music track. I created it to track guitar licks
I heard and to create relationships to the same lick in other tracks.

The plan is to create:

* a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for querying licks and their provenance so I can
navigate from one track to another to hear it played by another performer
* provide for publishing records to a public global data store for others to use
* use blockchain to attribute rights to the data and provide a Crypto asset for publisher to
receive payment for its use by others

## Installation
